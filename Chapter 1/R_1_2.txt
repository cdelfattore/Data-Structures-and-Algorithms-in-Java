Suppose that we create an array A of GameEntry objects, which has an integer scores field, and we clone A and store the result in an array B. If we then immediately set A[4].score equal to 550, what is the score value of the GameEntry object referenced by B[4]?

I guess cloning copies all of the memory locations? So, the value of B[4] will be 550, since A and B both reference the same
